# Models
Collection of TensorFlow Models for working with the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

### Dataset
The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is available at:
* MNIST dataset - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
    
The four gunzipped files should be placed the subdirectory './data/' of the 'Models/' folder.  The first time a model is called, the 'write_mnist_tfrecords()' function from the 'utils.py' file is executed in order to create the 'training.tfrecords' and 'validation.tfrecords' files used for training.  

### Running models
Run options for each model are definied in the flags.py file.  Default options are specified for each argument for convenience; to override a default option simply run, e.g.:
```
$ python 01_Classifier.py --batch_size 100
```

Model checkpoints, logs, and predictions are stored in the './Model/' subdirectory by default.  The models are run using tf.MonitoredTrainingSession and save checkpoints in './Model/Checkpoints/' periodically throughout the training process; models are automatically restored whenever checkpoints exist in this folder.

### Monitoring training
The current training loss is displayed for each step by default; this can be adjusted using the '--display_step' flag.  The training and validation loss can also be monitored using TensorBoard via:
```
$ tensorboard --logdir=./Model/logs
```

### Viewing predictions
The GAN and VAE models each save plots of the generated images in the './Model/predictions/' folder periodically throughout the training process.  The resolution of the predictions is upsampled to 64x64 by default and can be adjusted using the '--plot_res' flag.  The files 'plot_\*.png' in the predictions folder correspond to images generated from random normal samples in the latent space of the GAN and VAE models.  For the VAE model, 'data_\*.png' and 'pred_\*.png' files are also saved; these correspond to the current validation batch of images and the associated network predictions, respectively.
